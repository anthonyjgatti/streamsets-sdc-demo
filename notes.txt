Scenario

Disparate systems aquiring from multiple shopping stores

Each store has contracts for its own ERP system ending at different times so
  they're gonna want to run them until they die, because they already paid for.

They're going to keep buying companies, no matter what.

They need to funnel it into a single system.

Get rid of all those systems = 20 mil
Buy our tool and support = 100k
